Approach for this Project:The project aimed to predict wether a honey bee image contains pollen or not using dl models. To detect pollen in honeybee images, the approach involves collecting and preprocessing a diverse dataset. Utilizing a pre-trained deep learning model like VGG16 or DenseNet, adapt the classification head for binary detection. Trained the model with fine-tuned hyperparameters and validate its performance on a separate dataset. Post-processing involves setting a threshold for binary predictions.
